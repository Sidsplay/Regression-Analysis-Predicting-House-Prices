# Regression Analysis: Predicting House Prices

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of regression analysis to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms. The code uses a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

```

## Files

### `regression_model.py`

This Python script performs the following tasks:

- Generates a synthetic dataset with random values for square footage, number of bedrooms, and house prices.
- Splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Creates and trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model using mean squared error.
- Visualizes the predictions vs. actual values.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd regression_project
    ```

3. Install necessary packages:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

4. Run the regression model script:

    ```bash
    python src/regression_model.py
    ```

5. Examine the results:

    - The script will print the mean squared error of the model.
    - A scatter plot will be displayed, showing the predicted house prices vs. the actual house prices.

## Notes

- This project uses a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace it with your own dataset.
- Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific dataset and requirements.

Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of your Git repository if you plan to host the code on a version control platform. Feel free to customize the README further based on your preferences and specific use case.
